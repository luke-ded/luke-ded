## ✨ My Favorite Projects:

### **[walkUCF](https://github.com/luke-ded/walkucf)**:
At the University of Central Florida, students often use unconventional routes when walking across campus. As a result, traditional mapping services provide inaccurate info to those looking for the fastest paths. That's why I developed walkUCF, a virtual walking map web application built for how students genuinely walk.

walkUCF goes beyond the basics by allowing users to:   
🚪 Choose which building entrances to use.   
🏢 Walk through buildings.   
🅿️ Walk through parking lots.   
🌳 Walk across grass.   
🚦 Jaywalk.   
🚶‍➡️ Enter their own walking speed.

Check it out at [walkUCF.com](https://walkucf.com/)!

### **[FDelete](https://github.com/luke-ded/fdelete)**:
When taking code notes for a compiled language, those pesky executables end up littering the folder and make it difficult to view your notes later! That's why I developed FDelete, a windows application that removes all the files of desired extensions from the desired folders.

While this could have been a simple command line application, FDelete gives the user a better experience with:   
🎨 An intuitive User Interface.   
⚙️ Saved settings for fine grained control.   
🛡️ Built in safeguards.   
🚫 Invalid extension and invalid directory lists.
